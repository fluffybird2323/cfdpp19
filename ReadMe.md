Voting is a core part of a democracy, with methods ranging from eVMs to the use of a ballot box. However, online voting and offline platforms have few flaws like the limiting nature and reliability that cripple the process:
Few issues are :
 1.  <ol> Who controls the online platform?</ol>
  1. <ol>Can the central body be trusted to store and count votes?</ol>
  1. <ol>Who ensures the system availability for the duration of the election?</ol>
 1. <ol> How can votes be verified, even after the voting is finished</ol>
 
<h4>The main idea of this Blockchain solution is to emulate a Bitcoin transaction to a vote cast by a voter to the candidate selected by the voter. </h4>

Every vote transaction thus benefits from advantages of a Blockchain transaction,ie: It is non-modifiable; It is non-repudiable; It cannot be registered in multiple ways; All nodes possess a valid copy of the transaction.

A voter  will be casting his vote by transfering a Votecoin (a small amount of cryptocurrency as desired) to the wallet of their desiered candidate
