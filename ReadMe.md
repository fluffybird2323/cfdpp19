Voting is a fundamental element of any collaboration between individuals, with methods ranging from a show of hands and the use of a ballot box, to online voting and liquid democracy platforms. However, online voting and e-democracy platforms are subject to certain problems that undermine the definitive nature and certainty of the process:

    Who controls the online platform?
    How can I be certain that the votes are counted correctly?
    Who ensures the system availability for the duration of the election?
    How can votes be verified, even after the voting is finished
